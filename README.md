Digital Alarm System Developed with Python’s Basic Level Tkinter Library.
  This project is based on a digital clock and alarm system developed using Python’s popular Tkinter library. It features a user-friendly graphical interface. The system displays
the current time and date in real time while allowing users to receive a notification at a preset alarm time. It includes basic functionalities like input validation and alarm 
checking mechanisms. Users can set the alarm by providing the time in the HH:MM:SS format.
  This project serves as an excellent example for beginners in Python to learn graphical user interface (GUI) development and time-related operations.
